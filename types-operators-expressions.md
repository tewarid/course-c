title: Types, Operators and Expressions
---
## Introduction

- The basic C data objects are

  - Variables

  - Constants

- Operators act on data objects

- Expressions are composed of data objects and operators

## Variable Names

- Names are composed of letters and digits

  - Underscore is treated as a letter

- Must start with a letter

- Are case sensitive

- Have a size limit of 31 characters

- As a convention lower case is used for variable names

## Keywords

- Symbols reserved by C

- Cannot be used as variable names

| char     | enum    | int      | sizeof | unsigned |       |
| const    | extern  | long     | static | void     |       |
| continue | float   | register | struct | volatile |       |

## Basic Data Types

- Integer

  - char, short int, int, long int

  - signed and unsigned types

- Floating point

  - float

  - double, long double

- Size is implementation dependent

  - `<limits.h>` and `<float.h>` contain constants for sizes

## Integer types

- int is normally the natural size for a machine

- unsigned types store negative values in two's complement form

- char meant for holding single byte character code

  - insufficient for [Unicode and other codes](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Character-Handling.html)

|       | bits |     unsigned      |         signed         |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| long  | 32   | `0` to `2^32 - 1` | `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`  |
| int   | 32   | `0` to `2^32 - 1` | `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`  |
| short | 16   | `0` to `2^16 - 1` | `-2^15` to `2^15 - 1`  |
| char  | 8    | `0` to `2^8 - 1`  | `-2^7` to `2^7 - 1`   |

## Floating point types

- Maximum and minimum values implementation dependent

- Decimal precision is limited

|             |      Range       | Precision |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| float       | 1E-37 to 1E+37   | 6         |
| double      | 1E-308 to 1E+308 | 15        |
| long double | 1E-308 to 1E+308 | 15        |

## Constants

- Following types

  - Numeric

  - Character

  - String

  - Enumeration

## Numeric constants

- Integer constants

  - A sequence of numbers (4567) is an `int`

  - Signed long integers specified by suffixing `l` or `L` (`4567L`) and unsigned long integers by suffixing `ul` or `UL` (`4567UL`)

  - Octal values indicated with a leading `0`

  - Hexadecimal values indicated with leading `0x`

- Floating-point constants

  - A sequence of numbers with a decimal point (1.23) or an exponent (123E-2) or both (12.3E-1) is a double

  - Long doubles are indicated by suffixing `l` or `L`

## Character constants

- A character between single quotes (`'0'`) is a `char`

- A character constant represents the integer value of the character (`'0'` = 48 in ASCII character set)

- A character constant is more portable

## String constants

- A sequence of characters delimited by double quotes (`"hello world\n"`)

- Strings constants separated by white-spaces are concatenated at compile time
  - `"hello " "world\n"` becomes `"hello world\n"`

- Internally a string constant is terminated by a `'\0'` (null) character

- Function `strlen(s)` in `<string.h>` returns the size of a string

- A string is actually an array of char (`char []`)

## Escape sequences

- Some characters are hard to represent in character constants and string constants

- Escape sequences are used to represent such characters

  |      |                 |     |        |                    |
  | ---- | --------------- | --- | ------ | ------------------ |
  | `\a` | alert (beep)    |     | `\\`   | backslash          |
  | `\b` | backspace       |     | `\?`   | question mark      |
  | `\f` | formfeed        |     | `\'`   | single quote       |
  | `\n` | newline         |     | `\"`   | double quote       |
  | `\r` | carriage return |     | `\nnn` | octal number       |
  | `\t` | horizontal tab  |     | `\xhh` | hexadecimal number |
  | `\v` | vertical tab    |     | `\0`   | null character     |

## Constant expression

- Expressions involving only constants

- May be evaluated at compile time

- Can be used in the place of a constant

  ```c
  #define MAX 100
  int i = MAX;
  ```

## Enumeration constants

- A list of constant integers

- Values can be specified or generated

  ```c
  enum colors { RED = 'r', BLUE = 'b', GREEN = 'g'};

  enum dow { SUN = 1, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT};
  ```

- Variables of enum types can be declared

  ```c
  enum colors c = RED;
  ```

- DDD shows values of enum variables as symbols

## Variable Declarations

- All variables must be declared before use

- A declaration only specifies the nature of a variable (i.e. type)

- A declaration contains a type followed by a list of one or more comma separated names

  ```c
  char c, name [50];
  ```

- A variable may be initialized in its declaration

  ```c
  int i = MAX + 1, j = i;
  ```

- By prefixing `const` to a declaration, a variable can be declared as unchangeable

  ```c
  const double pi = 3.14;
  ```

## Arithmetic Operators

- Binary operators

  ```text
  + - * / %
  ```

- Unary operators

  ```text
  ++ -- + -
  ```

- Postfix / prefix unary operator usage

  ```c
  int i = 0, j;
  j = i++; /* j = 0, i = 1 */
  j = ++i; /* j = 2, i = 2 */
  ```

## Relational operators

- Equal and not equal

  ```text
  == !=
  ```

- Less than and less than or equal to

  ```text
  < <=
  ```

- Greater than and greater than or equal to

  ```text
  > >=
  ```

- No boolean type, a value of 0 represents FALSE, any other value is TRUE

## Logic operators

- Logical negation

  ```text
  !
  ```

- Logical AND

  ```text
  &&
  ```

- Logical OR

  ```text
  ||
  ```

## Bitwise operators

- Bitwise complement

  ```text
  ~
  ```

- Bitwise left and right shift

  ```text
  << >>
  ```

- Bitwise AND, OR, and exclusive OR (XOR)

  ```text
  & | ^
  ```

## Assignment operators

- Normal assignment

  ```text
  =
  ```

- Arithmetic

  ```text
  += -= *= /= %=
  ```

- Bitwise assignment operators

  ```text
  &= ^= |= <<= >>=
  ```

## Expressions

- Most expressions are assignments or functions calls

- If an expression is missing the statement is called a null statement

  - Can be used to supply an empty body for an iteration or loop

- All side effects from the expressions are completed before the next statement

## Side effects

- Side effects are unpredictable assignment to variables resulting from undefined order of evaluation of an expression

  - In function calls

    ```c
    printf("%d, %d", i + 1, i = j + 2 );
    printf("%d, %d, %d", i++, i++, i++);
    ```

  - Nested assignments

    ```c
    c = getchar() != EOF
    ```

  - Increment and decrement operators

    ```c
    a[i] = i++;
    ```

- Avoid side effects, don't depend on the results from your compiler

:::

::::

## Conditional expressions

- `lvalue = expr1 ? expr2 : expr3`

  `lvalue` is the value of the expression  
  `expr1` is evaluated first  
  `expr2` is evaluated if `expr1` is not 0 (i.e. true)  
  `expr3` is evaluated if `expr1` is 0 (i.e. false)

- This is equivalent to

  ```c
  if (expr1)  
    lvalue = expr2;  
  else  
    lvalue = expr3;  
  ```

## Automatic type conversion

- Wider conversions are automatic, e.g. `char` to `int`

- Beware mixing signed and unsigned values, `-1L > 1UL`

  `1UL`  
  `00000000000000000000000000000001`  

  `1L` as two's complement of `1L` (calculated as `~1+1` or `2^32 - 1`)  
  `11111111111111111111111111111111`

## Automatic type conversion rules

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

For an operator that takes two operands

- If one is `long double`, convert other to `long double`

- Else, if one is `double`, convert other to `double`

- Else, if one is `float`, convert other to `float`

- Else, if one is `unsigned long int`, convert other to `unsigned long int`

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Else, if one is `long int` and other is `unsigned int`
  - If a `long int` can represent all values of an `unsigned int`, convert both to `long int`
  - Else convert both to `unsigned long int`

- Else, if one is `long int`, convert other to `long int`

- Else, if one is `unsigned int`, convert other to `unsigned int`

- Else, convert both to `int`

::::

## Type casting

- Forced type conversions (coercion)

  (_type-name_) _expression_

- Required for _narrow_ conversions

- Can result in loss of data

  - Wide integers to narrow integers

  - Float or double to integers
